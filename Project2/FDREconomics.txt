                FDR's Economic Bill of Rights

In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident.
We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights
under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be
established for all regardless of station, race, or creed.

Among these are:
1. The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or
   shops or farms or mines of the Nation;
2. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing
   and recreation;
3. The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a
   return which will give him and his family a decent living;
4. The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in
   an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination
   by monopolies at home or abroad;
5. The right of every family to a decent home;
6. The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve
   and enjoy good health;
7. The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old
   age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;
8. The right to a good education.

All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we
must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these
rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.

America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part
upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into
practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at
home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.
